# SEMANTIC-DICTIONARY

# this project is to define a semantic web ontology for the english language to possibly be used in natural language processing. Mainly it is a nice project for my dyselxic brain to analyse and define how I see the english language. It will look at linking to other languages in the future to give a collective view of languages as a whole. Main focuses should be one to one direct translations to begin with.
